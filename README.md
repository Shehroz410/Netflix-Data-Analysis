# 🎬 Movie Genre Distribution Analysis

This project visualizes the distribution of movie genres using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries. It's a simple yet effective demonstration of how to analyze and present categorical data in a clear, graphical format.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Loads movie dataset using **pandas**
- Analyzes and counts the frequency of each **movie genre**
- Creates a horizontal **count plot** using **Seaborn's `catplot()`**
- Sorted bar chart for easy understanding
- Uses **Matplotlib** to add titles and improve visualization

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas 🐼
- Seaborn 🎨
- Matplotlib 📈

## 📷 Visualization

The main output is a horizontal bar chart showing how frequently each genre appears in the dataset.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- How to work with categorical variables in a dataset
- How to sort and order bar charts by frequency
- Practical use of Seaborn’s `catplot()` and Matplotlib for better visual design
